To interact with Evans Reflection utility follow the following steps:

1. Install Evans CLI from https://github.com/ktr0731/evans
2. Run the server in terminal ***go run api/server.go***
3. Open another terminal, and type if your server use tls encryption ***evans --tls --cacert app/cmd/tls/output/ca.crt --servername localhost -r -p 50051*** otherwise omit ***--tls --cacert app/cmd/tls/output/ca.crt*** in this way we are using evans in REPL mode ***-r***.

This example shows you how to build a Unary RPC server that works like Rest(1 Request -> 1 Response), the idea is to send a text from any language and this web service can tell you what language it belongs to, this project is structured into 2 folders: 

1. **demo** folder shows you a simple app in which you can interact with the [Language Detector library](https://github.com/abadojack/whatlanggo), you just need to run *main.go* golang file. 

2. **app** folder named contains a server/client RPC application, just run the *server.go* file first and after the *client.go* file.

3. **app/cmd/tls** this folder contains a bash file and a cng file. Setup those file with valid a domain if you need, for this example our domain is localhost. Run ***sh credentials*** and you will see generated files inside the **output** folder.

If you want to build by yourself the protofile located inside **app/rpc/proto** folder, there run ***make build*** command and you'll see the output inside **languagepb** folder, but first of all be sure you have protocol buffers compiler and GRPC plugin already setup, see this [link](https://github.com/cerezo074/GRPC/tree/main/Code%20Generation) if you want to know how to do it. 

***Note: Remember that this example uses Go Modules so you don't need to worry about externals dependencies those dependencies are downloaded automatically and you don't need to execute any go file inside your go path ðŸ˜¬.***
